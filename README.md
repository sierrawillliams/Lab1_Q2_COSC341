Lab 1: Android Basics (20 marks) 

The purpose of this lab is to help you get started with mobile application development with 
Android.  
Configuration note: 
When  you  create  your  app  on  Android  Studio,  be  sure  to  select  the  option  "Phone  and 
Tablet". Assignments will be marked using an Android Virtual Device (AVD) running a  Pixel 
3a with API 33. You must use Android Studio (with Java as the programming language), this 
is what the TAs will use to load, build, and run your code. 
Submission note: 
Upload a zip file containing the following folders to Canvas: Code and APK.  
- The Code folder should include two subfolders: Question 1 and Question 2 with the 
corresponding Android code.  
- APK folder should only contain two .apk files.
